The `ISB-CGC <https://isb-cgc.org>`_ aims to serve the needs of a broad range of cancer researchers ranging from scientists or clinicians who prefer to use an interactive web-based application to access and explore the rich TCGA, TARGET, CCLE, and COSMIC datasets, to computational scientists who want to write their own custom scripts using languages such as R or Python, accessing the data through APIs, and to algorithm developers who wish to spin up thousands of virtual machines to analyze hundreds of terabytes of sequence data.
