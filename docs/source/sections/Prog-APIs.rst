Programmatic access to ISB-CGC data and metadata is provided through ISB-CGC APIs built on Google's OpenAPI Endpoints. A SwaggerUI interface is also available, to try out the APIs and view their documentation. User-generated data such as cohort definitions, and user functions such as registering GCP projects is also available through the ISB-CGC API Endpoints. Note that all user-generated Endpoints require identity credentials for use.
