About the BEATAML1.0-CRENOLANIB
-------------------------------

The BEATAML1.0-CRENOLANIB data is from several studies focused on the effect of the drug Crenolanib on Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). It has been found that FLT3 mutations are associated with poor prognosis and commonly detected in AML patients. Crenolanib is a potent type I pan-FLT3 (GeneID:2322) inhibitor. It is effective against both internal tandem duplications (ITD) and resistance-conferring tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations. Usually, crenolanib monotherapy has a significant clinical benefit on AML patients that are heavily pretreated and have relapsed or were refractory but then the response will be transient and relapse occurred. Through these studies, it was found that crenolanib did not induce FLT3 activation loop mutation which is unlike other FLT3 inhibitors and low mutations of the FLT3 "gatekeeper" residue. It was found that mutations of NRAS and IDH2 emerged as mainly FLT3-independent subclones. And in crenolanib poor-responders, the genes TET2 and IDH1 co-occurred with the FLT3-mutant clone and were in enriched. The remaining patients exhibited a post-crenolanib expansion of mutations associated with epigenetic regulators, transcription factors, and cohesion factors, suggesting diverse non-FLT3 genetic/epigenetic mechanisms of crenolanib resistance. Crenolanib sensitivity was restored with combining drugs in experimental models.
