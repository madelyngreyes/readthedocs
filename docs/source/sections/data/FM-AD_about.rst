About the FM-AD
---------------

The `Foundation Medicine Adult Cancer Clinical Data set <https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-gdc/contributed-genomic-data-cancer-research/foundation-medicine/foundation-medicine>`_ (FM-AD) was a study conducted by Foundation Medicine Inc. (FMI) which is a molecular information company that specializes in precision medicine. FMI has generated genomic profiles for thousands of cancer patients, which are designed to match each patient with a personalized treatment plan.

About the FM-AD Data
--------------------
FM-AD data set  consists of 18,004 unique solid tumor samples that underwent genomic profiling on a single uniform platform as part of standard clinical care. The data set is derived from the FoundationOneÂ® genomic profiling assay version 2 that interrogates exonic regions of 287 cancer-related genes and selected introns from 19 genes known to undergo rearrangements in human cancer. The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) currently has VCF, TSV, and MAF data available. To see the GDC data portal with Foundation Medicine as program selected please select `here <https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository?facetTab=files&filters=%7B%22op%22%3A%22and%22%2C%22content%22%3A%5B%7B%22op%22%3A%22in%22%2C%22content%22%3A%7B%22field%22%3A%22cases.project.program.name%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22FM%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D&searchTableTab=cases>`_. There are 36,008 VCF files, 84 TSV files, and 42 MAF files available with 36,050 of them that are Controlled Access and 84 files which are Open Access. Files can be found within the ``isb-cgc.GDC_metadata`` tables in BigQuery.
