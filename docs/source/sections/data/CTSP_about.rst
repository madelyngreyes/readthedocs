About the CTSP
--------------

The `Clinical Trials Sequencing Project <https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/clinical-trial-sequencing>`_ (CTSP) is a joint collaboration from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) to promote the use of genomics in NCI-sponsored clinical trials and elucidate the molecular basis of response and resistance to therapies studied. Breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are the cancer types that are currently under study.


About the CTSP Data
-------------------

NCI utilized whole genome sequencing and/or whole-exome sequencing in conjunction with transcriptome sequencing to try to identify recurrent genetic alterations (mutations, deletions, amplifications, rearrangements) and/or gene expression signatures that would be important to the hypothesis(es) submitted by the investigators. The samples are processed and submitted for genomic characterization using pipelines and procedures established within The Cancer Genome Analysis (TCGA) project. For more information please `visit <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs001175.v2.p2>`_. 

There are 89 controlled access BAM files along with TSV files in the GDC. To see the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) data portal with Clinical Trial Sequencing Project please select `here <https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository?facetTab=files&filters=%7B%22op%22%3A%22and%22%2C%22content%22%3A%5B%7B%22op%22%3A%22in%22%2C%22content%22%3A%7B%22field%22%3A%22cases.project.program.name%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22CTSP%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D&searchTableTab=cases>`_. Files can be found within the ``isb-cgc.GDC_metadata`` tables in BigQuery.
