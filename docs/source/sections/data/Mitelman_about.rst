About Mitelman Database
-----------------------

The `Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations and Gene Fusions in Cancer <https://mitelmandatabase.isb-cgc.org/>`_  is devoted to genes, chromosomes, and cancer. The Mitelman Database is supported by NCI (National Cancer Institute), the Swedish Cancer Society and the Swedish Childhood Cancer. `The Mitelman Database <https://mitelmandatabase.isb-cgc.org/>`_ is available from the ISB-CGC to access and search the data.

There are five `searchers <https://mitelmandatabase.isb-cgc.org/search_menu>`_ available to searching through the data: 

* Cases Cytogenetics Searcher

  * allows you to query the individual patient cases using fields such as the aberration, breakpoint, morphology, and topography

* Gene Fusions Searcher

  * finds studies pertaining to gene rearrangements, in particular gene fusions, detected either as a consequence of cytogenetic aberrations or identified by sequencing

* Clinical Associations Searcher 

  * searches studies pertaining to clinical associations of cytogenetic aberrations and/or gene rearrangements.

* Recurrent Chromosome Aberrations Searcher

  * provides a way to search for structural and numerical abnormalities that are recurrent, i.e., present in two or more cases with the same morphology and topography

* References Searcher

  * queries only the references themselves, i.e., the references from the individual cases and the molecular biology and clinical associations

About Mitelman Data
-------------------

The information in the Mitelman Database relates cytogenetic changes and their genomic consequences, in particular gene fusions, to tumor characteristics, based either on individual cases or associations. All the data have been manually culled from the literature by Felix Mitelman in collaboration with Bertil Johansson and Fredrik Mertens. The database is updated quarterly in January, April, July, and October. The data can be accessed on the `ISB-CGC Mitelman Database <https://mitelmandatabase.isb-cgc.org/>`_.
