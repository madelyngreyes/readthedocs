================================================
Other Genomics BigQuery Data Available on Google
================================================

Google and others have made additional datasets available in BigQuery.  These can be used in joins with the ISB-CGC datasets.  The current list can be found `here <https://googlegenomics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/use_cases/discover_public_data/index.html>`_.  

It is possible that not all the datasets provided on this page have BigQuery data.  You can find that out by opening up that link for each dataset and seeing if there is a section called "Google BigQuery Dataset ID(s)".  If there is, you can make these available through your Google console by the same process as you did for the ISB-CGC datasets above or by clicking on the link for that dataset.
